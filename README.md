# CLASS-Chandrayaan-2
The Chandrayaan-2 Large Area Soft X-ray Spectrometer (CLASS) is an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) instrument designed for exploring lunar surface composition. It was sent to the Moon as a payload onboard the Chandrayaan-2 mission. CLASS comprises 16 Swept Charge Devices (SCD) dedicated to observing the soft X-ray energy range, covering an interval from ~0.4 to 20 keV. Like previous XRF experiments sent to the Moon, CLASS harnesses solar X-rays to excite elements in the lunar regolith, subsequently detecting the emitted XRF signals from these elements.

CLASS is proficient at identifying major and trace elements that constitute lunar rocks, including O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, and Fe, which are discernible in its XRF spectrum. This instrument can achieve this with a ground footprint of 12.5 km Ã— 12.5 km while operating from an orbit ~100 km above the lunar surface. The precursor to CLASS was the Chandrayaan-1 X-ray Spectrometer (C1XS).
